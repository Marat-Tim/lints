This Java package is a collection of "lints" (aka "checkers") for
[XMIR][xmir] (an intermediate representation of a
[EO][eo] program). This is not about static analysis or code
formatting. This is about best practices and readiness of code
for successful compilation and execution.

We use this package as a dependency in the
[EO-to-Java compiler][eo]:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.eolang</groupId>
  <artifactId>lints</artifactId>
  <version>0.0.8</version>
</dependency>
```

This is a non-exhaustive list of lints in the collection:

* A comment for an object must be 64+ characters
* A comment may only include printable ASCII characters
* A comment must be a valid Markdown text
* A comment may not have grammar mistakes, according to [aspell][aspell]
* The width of any line with a comment must be less than 80
* The compexity of an object must be within acceptable limits
* The number of void attributes in an object must be smaller than five
* The number of attached attributes in an object must be smaller than twelve
* A program must have mandatory metas: `package`, `architect`, `version`, etc.
* A test object must have the `@` attribute
* The `$.` prefix must be used only to avoid ambiguity
* The `^.` prefix must be used only to avoid ambiguity
* The `+rt` meta may be present only if the program has at least one atom
* The `+rt` meta must be present if the program has at least one atom
* The tail of the `+rt` must be strict: runtime + location
* The tail of the `+package` must have a name of a EO package
* The tail of the `+home` must have a valid URL
* The tail of the `+architect` must be a valid email
* Some metas must be unique, like `version`, `package`, and `home`
* An object referenced must either be local or in the `org.eolang` package
* The `body` object in `try`, `go.to` and `while` must be attached (with the `>>`)
* Names inside a program must be unique (no matter the scope of visibility)
* A void attribute must be used, unless the object is an atom
* The forma of an atom must be either from `org.eolang` or current package
* If an `+alias` is defined, it must be used in the program

It is possible to disable any particular linter in a program,
with the help of the `+unlint` meta.
