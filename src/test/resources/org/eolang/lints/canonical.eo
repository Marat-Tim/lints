# Times table, which is a canonical example of EO program.
# @todo #432:60min Upgrade EO parser to 0.55.0.
#  Currently, we cannot upgrade it due to [conflicts](https://github.com/objectionary/eo/issues/4036)
#  with new bytes format, introduced in the latest version. Once, the issue in EO will be solved,
#  We should update lints that working with bytes object, and then upgrade parser. Don't forget to
#  remove all "+unlint object-has-data" from EO programs.
